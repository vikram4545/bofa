As a team we developed and implemented a banking web app to store and fin
ancially service bank clients. Python was used as the core backend langua
ge along with its feature-rich web framework Django. I was tasked with im
plementing an e-verification and SMS notification service that would allo
w for more security and user authentication. Stacked HTML, JavaScript, 
JQuery, and AngularJS to design UI and easily utilize Django's templat
ing system. We also probed the possibility of Cassandra implementation 
as backend database, but instead chose MongoDB due to its light-weight 
and performance. I also made significant use of selenium for unit testing
 and test cases.
